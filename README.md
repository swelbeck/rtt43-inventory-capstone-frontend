# Home Inventory Management (Front-End)

## Description

This is the front-end portion of the **Inventory Management Application**, built using **React**. The application allows users to manage their inventory, add products to a shopping list, and track purchased items.

The front-end interacts with the back-end via RESTful API calls to perform CRUD operations on inventory items and categories.

## Features

- **Search Inventory**: Users can search for items in their inventory.
- **Add Items**: Add new items to the inventory.
- **Add to Shopping List**: Users can add items from the inventory to a shopping list.
- **Move Between Shopping and Bought**: Items can be moved between the "Shopping" and "Bought" sections.
- **Delete Items**: Items can be deleted from the inventory or shopping list.

## Technologies

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the back-end API.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
